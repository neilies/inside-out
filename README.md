# inside-out

Inside Out is an Android application (optimised for tablet) that enriches the collection of a newly opened science museum through contextual interaction with its artefacts. Without requiring the need for specially designed exhibitions, the application makes use of augmented reality and proximity technologies such as beacons to provide an enhanced experience with the museum's collection.

The application is being designed and developed by Tomasz Sk√≥rski and Neil Bates as a part of an assignment for the MSc Interaction Design programme from Tallinn University and Cyprus University of Technology.

A prototype for the application will be devloped using a visual programming tool, of which will be decided in due course. 

For more detailed information on the features, functionalities, and different interactions (with examples) - please refer to the <a href="https://github.com/neilies/inside-out/wiki">Wiki pages for this repository</a>.
