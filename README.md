# Inside Out

Inside Out is an Android application (optimised for tablet) that enriches the collection of a newly opened science museum through contextual interaction with its artefacts. Without requiring the need for specially designed exhibitions, the application makes use of augmented reality and proximity technologies such as beacons to provide an enhanced experience with the museum's collection.

## Intro

The application is a part of an assignment for the MSc Interaction Design programme from Tallinn University and Cyprus University of Technology.
